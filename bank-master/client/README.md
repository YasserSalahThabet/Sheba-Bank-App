# Bank Application Front-end

- npm install to add dependancies
- npm start to run the application

# Authentication

- The app is secured using JWT. When a user creates an account, their data is sent to the server through fetch api using a POST request.In the backend upon receiveing the user data, the password is hashed before being stored in the database. It user the userId generated by MongoDB to create a JWT token to authenticate the user. In response we get a JWT token and the user email. The email and token are both set to the local storage of the client's computer to persist login even when they close the tab. This is purely for good user experience where a user is logged in after creating an account instead of being redirected to the login page.

- The login component also works the same as the signup component, where user details are sent to the server using a POST request. In response we get JWT token and user's email address. The token is used to authenticate the user ald log them in into their account.

- On logout, the user's token in the local storage is deleted. An action type 'LOGOUT' is fired, in state management using React Context where user is set to null. This hence navigates the user to the login page since the account page is a protected route and they can only acces it when logged in.
